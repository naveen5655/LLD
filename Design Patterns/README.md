# Design Patterns

Design patterns are common solutions to software problems.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are grouped into three main types:

### 1. **Creational Patterns** (For creating objects)
These patterns simplify how objects are created and provide flexibility.

- **Singleton**: Only one instance of a class exists.
- **Factory Method**: A method decides which class to create.
- **Builder**: Step-by-step creation of complex objects.
- **Prototype**: Copy an existing object to create a new one.
- **Abstract Factory**: Create families of related objects.

### 2. **Structural Patterns** (For organizing code)
These patterns help organize classes and objects for easier design.

- **Adapter**: Connects incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation.
- **Composite**: Treats a group of objects as one.
- **Decorator**: Adds new features to objects without changing their code.
- **Facade**: Provides a simple interface to a complex system.
- **Flyweight**: Shares objects to save memory.
- **Proxy**: Controls access to another object.

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns** (For object interaction)
These patterns focus on how objects work together.

- **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects when one changes.
- **Strategy**: Switch between different algorithms easily.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request through a chain of handlers.
- **State**: Changes an object's behavior based on its state.
- **Mediator**: Centralizes communication between objects.
- **Template Method**: Defines the basic steps of an algorithm and lets you change parts of it.
- **Iterator**: Loops through a collection without exposing its structure.
- **Visitor**: Adds operations to a group of objects without changing their structure.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

- **Reusable**: Use tried-and-tested solutions.
- **Organized**: Keep your code clean and structured.
- **Efficient**: Solve problems faster with less effort.
- **Understandable**: Patterns make it easier to work in teams.
