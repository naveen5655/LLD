# Design Patterns

Design patterns are common solutions to software problems that have been proven over time. They help in creating maintainable, scalable and flexible software systems.

## Types of Design Patterns

### **Creational Patterns**  
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a way that suits the situation.

- **Factory Pattern**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class to be created.
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.
- **Builder Pattern**: Constructs complex objects step by step.

### **Structural Patterns**  
These patterns deal with object composition, helping to form large structures from smaller objects.

- **Decorator Pattern**: Adds functionality to an object dynamically without modifying its code.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Converts one interface to another, making incompatible interfaces work together.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system, hiding its complexities.

### **Behavioral Patterns**  
These patterns focus on communication between objects, managing responsibility and how objects interact with each other.

- **Observer Pattern**: Notifies multiple objects about changes in the state of another object.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, allowing them to be interchangeable at runtime.
