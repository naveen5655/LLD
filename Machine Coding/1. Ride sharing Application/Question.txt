Design a Ride sharing application where drivers can offer rides (origin, destination, no of seats) any rider 
can request rides (origin, destination, no of seats).

There is an algo to choose to calculate Ride amount charged for a given ride based on distance and no of seats.

1. When the ride closes, show the amount charged to the rider.
2. Ride amount if No of seats >= 2 : No of kilometers * No of seats * 0.75 * Amount Charged per KM
3. Ride amount if No of seats = 1 : No of kilometers * Amount Charged per KM

The program should take as input two or more drivers and a set of riders requesting rides. Multiple rides
can happen simultaneously.

Assumptions :
1. Assume Amount charged per KM = 20
2. No of Kilometers = destination - origin
3. All values are Integer

Test Case:
A requesting for ride R1
INPUT: A requests 50, 60, 1,
OUTPUT: Ride Amount: 10 * 20 (Amount/Km) = 200
A requesting for ride R1
INPUT: A requests 50, 60, 2,
OUTPUT: Ride Amount: 10 * 2 * 0.75 * 20 (Amount/Km) = 300

Bonus:
● Upgrade the rider to a preferred rider if he has done in more than 10 rides.
● Preferred Rider amount if No of seats >= 2 : No of kilometers * No of seats * 0.5 * Amount Charged per KM
● Preferred Ride amount if No of seats = 1 : No of kilometers * Amount Charged per KM * 0.75 


Functionalities expected:
● Add Driver(name)
● Add Rider(name)
● Create Ride (id, origin, destination, no of seats)
● Create/Update Ride (id, origin, destination, no of seats)
● Withdraw Ride (id)
● Close ride and return ride amount charged
